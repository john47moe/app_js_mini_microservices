# mini-microservices-app

This is a mini-microservices-app using mern stack.

In this simple app i used react for our frontend web client, express framework for REST api.

The is no database involved in this app as its very simple and easy to understand.

Basically there will be post request from client browser and there will be a list of posts display in same browser instantly.

Inside that list of posts, you can make a comment. Once you comment there will be a comment display under that post.

Specific posts have their own specific comment.

In this simple app i used async microservice with event bus and each service have their own router and logic isolated.

Below is the overview of this app.
